 Used Car Price Analysis â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) This project explores a dataset of used cars to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that impact pricing. It is the first step in building a predictive model for estimating car prices based on various features like mileage, engine specs, brand, ownership, and fuel type.

 Key Objectives
Perform comprehensive data cleaning, handling missing values and formatting issues.

Conduct descriptive statistics on key numerical and categorical features.

Create detailed visualizations to explore price trends across fuel types, locations, ownership types, and manufacturing years.

Analyze correlations and feature relationships to understand what drives car prices.

Identify outliers and data quality issues.

Prepare the dataset for future machine learning modeling.
